# Based on https://yhbt.net/yahns/examples/yahns%40.service
# ==> /etc/systemd/system/battlecatsrolls@.service <==
# Since SIGUSR2 upgrades do not work under systemd, this service
# file allows starting two (or more) simultaneous services
# during upgrade (e.g. battlecatsrolls@1 and battlecatsrolls@2) with the intention
# that they are both running during the upgrade process.
#
# This allows upgrading without downtime, using battlecatsrolls@2 as a
# temporary hot spare:
#
#   systemctl start battlecatsrolls@2
#   sleep 2 # wait for battlecatsrolls@2 to boot, increase as necessary for big apps
#   systemctl restart battlecatsrolls@1
#   sleep 2 # wait for battlecatsrolls@1 to warmup
#   systemctl stop battlecatsrolls@2
