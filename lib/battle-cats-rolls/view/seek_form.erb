      The game will rotate the rare cat if it's followed by the same rare cat.
      You don't have to consider this while filling the picks because the
      program will consider this for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, suppose you got Tin Cat, and then Rocker Cat. We won't
      know if you really rolled that, or it's actually two Tin Cats in a row.
      Again, the program will consider this possibility so you don't need to
      worry about it.
